# Privacy Infrastructure for Smart Glasses

Build smart glasses apps without privacy concerns.

IMG

Smart glasses apps face privacy hurdles. This real-time privacy filter sits between the camera and the app, automatically ensuring compliance.

**Features:**

- **Blurs faces** of non-consenting individuals
- **Manages consent** (e.g., detects verbal consent such as “I consent to be captured” and remembers it)
- **Real-time processing** – 720p 30fps on laptop
- **100% offline** – no cloud dependencies
- **Recording**

**Developer-friendly:**

- Easy camera replacement
- RTMP input / multiple output formats
- HTTP API for control

## Demo

VID

Using a smartphone as the camera. Smart glasses demos [here](https://x.com/caydengineer/status/1945236074961236481) and [here](https://x.com/s_diana_k/status/1944500312116723973).

## Quick Start

See the [backend README](./backend/README.md), [example app README](./examples/rewind/README.md), and [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for technical details.

## Use Cases

Works with any camera-based app, for example:

- **AI Assistants** – Memory augmentation without privacy risks
- **Social Apps** – Live streaming with automatic protection
- **Enterprise** – Compliant workplace recording
- **Content Creation** – Automatic face blurring for vlogs

## Roadmap

- Additional privacy filters (text, objects)
- Speech anonymization
- Location-based auto shutoff
- Legal compliance templates
- VLM integration
- Active speaker detection
- More input protocols (currently RTMP)
- etc.
