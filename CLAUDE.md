# Real-time Video Privacy Infrastructure

## Project Overview

This repository implements a privacy-preserving video processing system for smart glasses and similar applications. It provides real-time face anonymization with consent management, allowing developers to build applications without privacy concerns.

## Project Structure

- `./backend/filter/` - Real-time privacy filter implementation (Python)
- `./backend/api/` - Control API server (FastAPI)
- `./examples/rewind/` - Reference implementation and inspector UI (React/TypeScript)

## Key Components

### 1. Privacy Filter (`./backend/filter/`)

High-performance multi-threaded video processing pipeline with face anonymization and transcription:

**Features:**
- Receives RTMP input streams with video and audio
- Detects and anonymizes faces using YuNet neural network
  - Supports two modes: Gaussian blur (default) or solid ellipse masking
  - Configure via `FACE_ANONYMIZATION_MODE` environment variable: `"blur"` or `"solid_ellipse"`
- Face recognition for consented users using face_recognition library
- Real-time speech transcription using separated VAD and Whisper threads for non-blocking processing
- Automatic consent detection from transcribed speech using local LLM
- Consent-triggered head image capture and face feature extraction
- File-based consent management with real-time monitoring using watchfiles
- Automatic loading of existing consent files on startup
- Dynamic consent addition/revocation through file system changes
- Selective face anonymization - consented faces remain visible with name labels
- Outputs to RTSP with preserved audio
- MediaMTX exposes WebRTC stream for consumption and records video
- Multi-threaded architecture with queue-based communication
- Graceful shutdown and comprehensive health monitoring

```

**Threading Model:**
- **Input Thread**: Demuxes RTMP stream into video/audio queues
- **Video Thread**: Processes frames with face detection/recognition, selective anonymization, and consent captures
- **Audio Thread**: Transcodes audio to Opus for WebRTC
- **VAD Thread**: Real-time Voice Activity Detection (non-blocking)
- **Speech Worker Thread(s)**: Background Whisper transcription and consent detection
- **Output Thread**: Muxes processed streams to RTSP
- **Monitor Thread**: Health monitoring and metrics collection
- **Consent Monitor Thread**: Watches consent_captures/ directory for real-time file changes (runs via watchfiles)

**Transcription & Consent Detection:**
The transcription system uses a non-blocking architecture to prevent real-time degradation:
- VAD Thread continuously processes audio in real-time, detecting speech boundaries
- When speech ends, complete segments are queued for transcription
- Speech Worker Thread(s) consume segments and run Whisper inference in the background
- Transcribed text is analyzed by a local LLM to detect explicit consent phrases
- Consent detection identifies both the consent status and speaker's name when available
- This separation ensures VAD never waits for transcription, maintaining real-time performance

**Face Recognition & Consent Management:**
- When consent is detected via speech, the system captures a head image of the largest face (assumed to be the speaker)
- Head images are saved to `./consent_captures/` with format `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_[name].jpg`
- On startup, all existing consent files are loaded and face features extracted
- File system monitoring via watchfiles detects real-time consent changes:
  - Adding a file grants consent for that person
  - Deleting a file revokes consent for that person
- Face features are extracted using face_recognition library (128-dimensional encodings) and stored in an in-memory database
- Multiple captures per person are supported for improved recognition accuracy
- In subsequent frames, all detected faces are matched against the consented faces database
- Recognized consented faces remain visible with green name labels displayed above them
- Unrecognized faces are anonymized (blurred or masked) for privacy protection

```bash
# Default: Gaussian blur
uv run filter/main.py

# Alternative: Solid ellipse masking (fits face shape)
FACE_ANONYMIZATION_MODE=solid_ellipse uv run filter/main.py
```

### 2. Control API (`./backend/api/`)

FastAPI-based REST API for consent management and system control:

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /consents` - List all consented individuals
- `GET /consents/{id}/image` - Retrieve consent face image
- `DELETE /consents/{id}` - Revoke consent for a person

**Running the API:**
```bash
uv run fastapi dev api/main.py
```

### 3. Example App (`./examples/rewind/`)

React/TypeScript application showcasing the privacy infrastructure:

- Real-time WHEP video streaming display
- Connection status monitoring
- Consent management UI integrated with Control API
  - View list of consented individuals with their face images
  - Display consent timestamp and person's name
  - Revoke consent with confirmation dialog
  - Auto-refresh consent list every 5 seconds
- Recording playback with MediaMTX integration
  - View list of available recordings with timestamps and duration
  - Play recordings in modal with full video controls
  - Delete recordings with confirmation
  - Auto-refresh recording list every 10 seconds
- AI chat integration (planned)

Run these commands before committing changes:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## Tips

- You can run Python like: `uv run python foo.py`
